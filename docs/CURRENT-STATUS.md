# Current implementation and verification

Updated October 22, 2026 (JST). **Source code, published releases, CI and physical acceptance are different evidence levels.** This is the current status page, not a chronological PR log.

## Release status

- **Published closed-beta prerelease:** [v1.18.0](https://github.com/SteezyMode/OptiplexNow/releases/tag/v1.18.0), October 21, 2026. Download the versioned `OptiPlex-Now_1.18.0_amd64.deb` and verify the release `SHA256SUMS`. This package includes the existing-host client plus a **guarded experimental clean-host Wolf pilot**, not the full three-pillar installer. [Release process](RELEASE-PROCESS.md).
- **Physical client acceptance and follow-up:** [October 21 MacBook test report](QA-MACBOOK-2026-10-21.md) on Linux Mint XFCE v1.18.0 observed Tailscale/server discovery, Moonlight pairing, Wolf XFCE and Jellyfin playback **after manual URL Settings correction** (audio not separately measured). Steam initially failed. On **October 22**, direct Moonlight Steam launch succeeded on the MacBook **after backing up its fresh Wolf Steam directory and manually symlinking it to the existing owner Steam state** (details in [#152](https://github.com/SteezyMode/OptiplexNow/issues/152) and [#154](https://github.com/SteezyMode/OptiplexNow/issues/154)). This verifies a working streamed Steam application, **not** a complete game/input/performance acceptance or zero-terminal first-run setup. Pairing and persistence defects remain; **Beta 1 not accepted.**
- **Source and release distinction:** [PR #142](https://github.com/SteezyMode/OptiplexNow/pull/142) removed Music Server Profiles from the onboarding wizard on `main` after v1.18.0 was tagged. [PR #143](https://github.com/SteezyMode/OptiplexNow/pull/143) proposes collapsed optional wake controls. Neither should be represented as included in the tested v1.18.0 install. CI and existing host pilot checks do not prove a clean host deployment or an actual Steam game stream.

## October 22 owner Steam source-only development (unreleased)

Following the physical MacBook/Mac mini tests, merged PRs #162, #163 and #164
added **read-only Wolf profile inventory**, **developer-only owner/device
policy**, and an **offline named Steam lobby request planner**. Current PR #165
adds a guarded **host-local Create/Join transaction** with a durable
fail-closed launch lease and simulated failure-path tests. These files are
source-level preparation, not installed operational host services. Normal
client Games still launches the legacy direct Moonlight Steam app, Wolf's
direct-app permissions are not restricted by NOW's policy, and fresh-owner
client P0 remains **unaccepted**. The transaction has not been executed on
the user's Wolf server. See [engineering trail](ENGINEERING-TRAIL.md) and [#154](https://github.com/SteezyMode/OptiplexNow/issues/154).

## Capability status

| Capability | In current source | Real-world acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GTK3 client, saved settings, Games/Videos entry points, tray, diagnostics | Implemented for preconfigured hosts | v1.18.0 Mint client test passed Videos launch and playback after a manual URL fix; wizard URL persistence failed (#147); tray resize failed (#146) |
| Tailscale graphical setup, discovery and SSH trust/enrollment | Implemented GUI and helpers | v1.18.0 real client recognized existing Tailscale, discovered Wolf host, presented native SSH fingerprint and password dialogs; new login, verification outcome, reconnect and negative paths not accepted |
| Wolf/Moonlight connection and pairing | Pairing bridge implemented | Genuine Flatpak/AppImage pairs observed; Wolf XFCE AppImage stream passed; Steam AppImage streaming passed October 22 **only after manual Wolf server-state symlink repair** (#152, #154); buried approval window, manual refresh and missing completion feedback (#144, #145) |
| Moonlight and encrypted backup GUI | Flatpak guided install and AppImage selection implemented | Fresh client Flatpak install observed; legacy Intel Flatpak codec warnings; AppImage XFCE streamed; backup and upgrade preservation not tested |
| Owner-configured media, downloads and files | Videos/Music/Downloads URLs, SFTP and Gluetun status; no managed media install | Jellyfin content playback on existing host physically passed from Mint client with manually saved URL; audio not separately measured; downloads, files, VPN leak and managed Jellyfin **not** tested; no-URL service onboarding is #148 |
| Optional music service | Music link and existing-host profile export for a DroppedNeedle/slskd/qBittorrent/Gluetun configuration | Experimental for general users, no bundled DroppedNeedle installation, recommendations or Spotify-like catalog |
| Server Setup review | Separate GTK window; real read-only preflight and plan shipped in PR build | Real hardware observation useful, but **not** an installation certificate |
| Clean NOW-managed Wolf installation | Developer/alpha implementation in `server/host_install.py` and GUI, AMD/Intel/NVIDIA; immutable image, root recheck, dedicated state | **No confirmed clean physical host install** |
| NVIDIA userspace driver volume | `host_nvidia.py`: version-specific build with official installer SHA256 check; no host-driver replacement | Physical encode and driver-update migration/rollback **unverified** |
| Separate game sessions preserving host display | Core Wolf-based product requirement; Wolf supports virtual app/session concepts | **Not yet physically verified end-to-end by NOW on a clean host** |
| Windows clients and hosts | Explicit roadmap: Windows client first, independent-session Windows host later | Neither is implemented; Windows host adds licensing/technical feasibility gates |
| Owner-mediated automatic device access by email | Future design only | Not implemented |
| Turnkey install, dependency setup, repair, upgrades, uninstall | No complete end-to-end implementation | Not alpha-accepted |

A running Docker container is **not** an active session, verified hardware encoder or successfully paired streaming client. Unknown service status remains unknown.

## Technical boundaries

- The [public-alpha product contract](PUBLIC-ALPHA.md) requires **all three** physically validated workflows: independent games, Jellyfin video and VPN-isolated remote download administration. The experience must keep the physical host desktop usable and ordinary services outside the download VPN. The role model is **owner/admin** (downloads, file management and settings) versus **member/viewer** (authorized playback and optionally approved gaming), enforced server-side. **None of that full stack or access boundary is accepted today.**
- Published v1.18.0 includes an **experimental, guarded clean-host Wolf-only installer** requiring a clean Ubuntu/Pop!_OS 24.04 amd64 host, an OS administrator prompt, Docker/Compose already present and manually verified immutable image inputs. It has **no clean physical host acceptance** and does not install Docker, Jellyfin, media services or VPN downloads. The main existing-host client does not automatically provision any service.
- Install code refuses preexisting NOW-managed workspaces/projects and Wolf port conflicts. It does not adopt or delete user containers. The live reference host is **not** an installation test target.
- NVIDIA's manual driver-volume first-install path exists, but automatic regeneration and safe migration after a driver update do not. The installer is not byte-for-byte reproducible because base image/apt dependencies are not fully pinned. [Host installer contract](HOST-INSTALLER.md).
- The client remains modularizing incrementally. `src/main.c` is still a substantial GTK controller; native tests and sanitizers do not cover every UI path or field condition.
- The source also retains separate experimental host staging, transaction and local-authorization modules. Their tests do **not** establish that these prototypes are deployed or connected to the operational installer.

## Immediate acceptance gates

**Next action: automate verified owner Steam-profile continuity for each authorized client (#154), fix pairing and settings persistence defects, and validate Games plus existing Jellyfin Videos for two trusted household users on the working host. The MacBook Steam launch succeeded October 22 after manual repair, but automated first-run setup has not passed. Prepare an independent clean-host physical test separately.** Use the [Host installer acceptance checklist](HOST-INSTALLER.md#physical-host-acceptance-before-alpha-sign-off) for a **clean server plus a second client**. Record OS, GPU/driver, Docker/Compose, Wolf digest, package build, observed video/audio/input and recovery behavior.

Continue [Beta 1 client acceptance](BETA-ACCEPTANCE.md) against an owner-approved existing host. The [MacBook report](QA-MACBOOK-2026-10-21.md) is a partial device pass and a set of blocking defects; restart/upgrade/reconnection, new Tailscale sign-in and full gaming remain open. The two acceptance tracks must not be conflated.

**Do not announce a validated alpha or commercial readiness based on source and CI alone.** Fix physical-test defects before adding more server frameworks, simulated lifecycle features or general-purpose dashboards.
